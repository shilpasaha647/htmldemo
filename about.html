    <p>According to Wikipedia event management is "the application of project management to the creation and development of large-scale events such as festivals, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts and conventions" which sounds reasonable if a little long-winded. There are a number of important things an event management company does, some obvious and others less so. A good event company will provide a range of resources and services as well as highly experienced personnel who can ensure the smooth running of the event, whether large or small.</p>
